# DistributedSystems_2
This project is made with the purpose of familiarizing ourselves with microservices. More
specifically, with the use of Docker.

The API documentation can be found on [Postman](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/11153633/Uz5CLJDv)


To run the project I included a script called run.sh, which can be run with the commands ‘bash
run.sh’. This calls the docker-compose.yml file, which in turn instantiates all the Docker
containers and the Docker image.
